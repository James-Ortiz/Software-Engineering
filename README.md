Follow these commands to get set up to the repository:
 
  -git init

  -git remote add origin git@github.com:James-Ortiz/Software-Engineering.git 
   
   
  To set up Git follow these links and their instructions in order: 

  - https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/(setup your config)
 
  - https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key/(setup you ssh key allowing access)
 
  - https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/(add ssh key to your github account)
  
  - You may need to do another git init after all this to set up with any updated settings for git.
 

  - Once you have that set up you should be able to pull from master and begin working the work flow is as follows: 
 
  - Pull from master (git pull origin master)
  - Create a new branch to work on(git checkout -b "Branch name")
  - Apply whatever changes needed, files added etc. 
  - When you are ready to push up the changes first check (git status)
  - All files you want to add likely in red. (git add "file name") use . for all
  - Check status again you should see desired files turned green. 
  - If all looks good then commit changes (git commit -m "commit message")
  - Finally you are ready to push (git push) 	
  - For a trackable branch (git push -u origin "branch name")
  - Go onto github account and merge, or notify someone in the group to review
  - Once the new changes have been merged go back to master(git checkout master)
  - Then repeat process for next set.
